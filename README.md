# Neovim Config

This is my personal Neovim configuration. 

## Dependencies

This configuration requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- fd
- ripgrep
- cmake
- zig

## Setup Instructions

1. **Backup Your Current Configuration**  
   Before making any changes, it's a good idea to back up your existing Neovim configuration. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.config
   mv nvim nvim.bak
   ```

2. **Clone the New Configuration**  
   Next, you will clone my Neovim configuration repository. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lukeburton00/nvim-config
   ```

3. **Move the New Configuration**  
   After cloning, move the new configuration into the appropriate directory:
   ```bash
   mv nvim-config nvim
   ```

4. **Clean Up Old Data**  
   If you are replacing your current configuration, make sure to delete any old Neovim data. This data is usually located in the following directories:
   - `~/.local/share/nvim`
   - `~/.local/state/nvim`
   - `~/.cache/nvim`

## LSP Setup

Both ```Mason``` and ```nvim-lspconfig``` are configured to automatically set up any language server you install locally.

### Example

To install the `clangd` language server, simply run:
```:MasonInstall clangd```

You can now open a C/C++ file and start coding!
